Automatically detect and remove unused NuGet package references in your .NET projects. Keep your codebase lean, fast, and secure.

## ‚ö° Getting Started

You can install NuGone as a .NET global tool:

```bash
dotnet tool install --global nugone
```

After installation, you can use the `nugone` command anywhere:

```bash
nugone analyze --project MySolution.sln
```

For more usage instructions, see future documentation updates.

## üöÄ Usage

To detect unused NuGet packages in your .NET projects, use the following command:

```
nugone analyze --project <SOLUTION_OR_PROJECT_PATH>
```

**Options:**
- `--output json`   Show results in JSON format
- `--verbose`       Show detailed analysis output

**Example:**
```
nugone analyze --project MySolution.sln --output json
