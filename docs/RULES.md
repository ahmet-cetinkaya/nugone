# RULES

These rules must be followed for all code generation and review tasks in this project:

1. **SOLID Principles**
    - Ensure code is modular, maintainable, and adheres to SOLID design principles.

2. **Naming & Formatting**
    - Use clear, descriptive names for all identifiers.
    - Apply consistent formatting for maximum readability.

3. **Comments**
    - Add explanatory comments only for non-obvious logic or complex algorithms.
    - Avoid comments for straightforward or self-explanatory code.

4. **Performance & Magic Values**
    - Optimize performance and resource usage without sacrificing clarity.
    - Consider time and space complexity in all solutions.
    - Do not use magic strings or numbers; use constants or enums instead.

5. **Error Handling & Validation**
    - Implement robust error handling and input validation throughout the codebase.

6. **Standard Libraries & Frameworks**
    - Leverage standard libraries and frameworks instead of reinventing common functionality.

7. **Modularity & Coupling**
    - Design code to be modular and loosely coupled to improve testability.

8. **DRY Principle**
    - Avoid duplicating logic; always adhere to DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principles.

9. **Security**
    - Follow security best practices (e.g., sanitize inputs) to prevent vulnerabilities.

10. **Defensive Programming**
    - Apply defensive programming techniques: validate all inputs, anticipate incorrect usage, and fail gracefully with informative errors.
