# RFC-0001: CLI Architecture And Command Design

## Related Module

**CLI**

## Summary

Define the architecture, command structure, and extensibility model for the NuGone CLI tool, which detects and removes unused NuGet packages in .NET projects.

## Motivation

A clear, modular CLI design is essential for usability, maintainability, and future extensibility. The CLI must support cross-platform usage, intuitive commands, and robust error handling.

## Detailed Design

### Cli Entry Point

- Command: `nugone`
- Subcommands: `analyze`, `remove`, `config` (planned)
- Follows standard .NET CLI conventions for argument parsing and help output.

### Command Structure

- `nugone analyze [options]` — Analyze project(s) for unused packages.
- `nugone remove [options]` — Remove unused packages.
- `nugone config [options]` — Manage configuration (future).

### Options And Flags

- Consistent flag naming (e.g., `--dry-run`, `--format`, `--output`, `--project`, `--help`).
- Support for both short and long flags where appropriate (e.g., `-y` for `--yes`).
- All commands validate and sanitize input.

### Extensibility

- New subcommands can be added with minimal changes to the CLI core.
- Command handlers are modular and loosely coupled.

### Cross-Platform Support

- CLI must run on Windows, macOS, and Linux.
- .NET Core 3.1+ as the minimum supported runtime.

### Error Handling

- Informative error messages and exit codes.
- Fail gracefully on invalid input or unexpected errors.

## Alternatives Considered

- Single-command CLI with sub-modes (rejected for clarity and extensibility).
- Platform-specific binaries (rejected in favor of .NET cross-platform support).

## Drawbacks

- Modular command structure may introduce slight startup overhead.

## Adoption

- All CLI development must follow this structure.
- Future commands/extensions must adhere to the modular handler pattern.
