# RFC-0004: Package Removal And Safety Mechanisms

## Related Module

**Package Removal**

## Summary

Define the workflow and safeguards for removing unused NuGet packages, including backup, confirmation, build validation, and rollback.

## Motivation

Safe and reliable package removal is critical to prevent accidental project breakage and ensure user trust.

## Detailed Design

### Removal Workflow

- Remove a single unused package: `nugone remove --package <PackageName>`
- Remove all unused packages: `nugone remove --all-unused`
- Prompt for confirmation unless `--yes` is specified.
- Create a backup of the project file before removal if `--backup` is specified.
- Attempt to rebuild the project after removal unless `--no-build` is specified.
- If build fails, roll back changes and report errors.

### Backup And Rollback

- Backups are timestamped and stored alongside the project file.
- Rollback restores the backup if removal or build fails.

### Error Handling

- All errors are reported with clear messages and exit codes.
- Failures do not leave the project in a broken state.

### Input Validation

- Validate package names and project paths before removal.
- Sanitize all user input.

## Alternatives Considered

- No backup/rollback (rejected for safety).
- Always rebuild (rejected for flexibility).

## Drawbacks

- Backup and rollback add minor overhead.

## Adoption

- All removal logic must implement these safety mechanisms.
